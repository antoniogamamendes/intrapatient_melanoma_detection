# Intrapatient Melanoma Detection

This code was developed during my Master's Thesis under the supervision of Dra. Catarina Barata.
Afterwards, this work was also subject to a publication for the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI2023) - "INTRAPATIENT DIAGNOSIS FOR MELANOMA SKIN CANCER"

Disclaimer: The code is not beautiful and it will not work if you just clone and play because there are hardcoded paths and auxiliar data files that you need to run it. Anyway I am sharing it in case someone is interested in underestanding any detail that is not clear in the documents refered above.
